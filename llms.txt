# Transition

### Characterise Transitions in Test Result Status in Longitudinal Studies

Analyse data from longitudinal studies to characterise changes in values
of semi-quantitative outcome variables within individual subjects, using
high performance C++ code to enable rapid processing of large datasets.
A flexible methodology is available for codifying these state
transitions.

## Installation

You can install the currently-released version from CRAN with this R
command:

``` r
install.packages("Transition")
```

Alternatively, you can install the latest development version of
Transition from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Mark-Eis/Transition")
```

### Transition Package Overview: –

- Identify temporal transitions in test results for individual subjects
  in a longitudinal study with
  [`get_transitions()`](https://mark-eis.github.io/Transition/reference/Transitions.md).

- Interpolate these transitions into a data frame for further analysis
  with
  [`add_transitions()`](https://mark-eis.github.io/Transition/reference/Transitions.md).

- Identify the previous test result for individual subjects and
  timepoints in a longitudinal study with
  [`get_prev_result()`](https://mark-eis.github.io/Transition/reference/PreviousResult.md).

- Interpolate these previous test results into a data frame for further
  analysis with
  [`add_prev_result()`](https://mark-eis.github.io/Transition/reference/PreviousResult.md).

- Identify the previous test date for individual subjects and timepoints
  in a longitudinal study
  [`get_prev_date()`](https://mark-eis.github.io/Transition/reference/PreviousDate.md).

- Interpolate these previous test dates into a data frame for further
  analysis with
  [`add_prev_date()`](https://mark-eis.github.io/Transition/reference/PreviousDate.md).

- Identify unique values for subjects, timepoints and test results in
  longitudinal study data with
  [`uniques()`](https://mark-eis.github.io/Transition/reference/uniques.md).

#### Methodology

*Transition* uses high performance C++ code seamlessly integrated into R
using [`Rcpp`](https://www.rcpp.org) to enable rapid processing of large
longitudinal study datasets.
