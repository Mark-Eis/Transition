# Find Previous Test Date for Subject

`get_prev_dates()` identifies the previous test date for individual
subjects and timepoints in a longitudinal study.

`add_prev_date()` interpolates these previous test dates into a data
frame for further analysis.

## Usage

``` r
add_prev_date(
  object,
  subject = "subject",
  timepoint = "timepoint",
  result = "result",
  prev_date = "prev_date"
)

get_prev_date(
  object,
  subject = "subject",
  timepoint = "timepoint",
  result = "result"
)
```

## Arguments

- object:

  a [`data.frame`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/data.frame.html) (or object
  coercible by
  [`as.data.frame()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/as.data.frame.html) to a
  data frame) containing the data to be analysed.

- subject:

  [`character`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/character.html), name of the
  column (of type [`integer`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/integer.html) or
  [`factor`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/factor.html)) identifying individual
  study subjects; default `"subject"`.

- timepoint:

  `character`, name of the column recording time points (as
  [`Dates`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Dates.html)) of testing of subjects;
  default `"timepoint"`.

- result:

  `character`, name of the column (of type
  [`ordered factor`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/factor.html), or binary, see
  *Details*) recording test results; default `"result"`.

- prev_date:

  `character`, name to be used for a new column to record previous test
  dates; default `"prev_date"`.

## Value

- `add_prev_date()`:

  A [`data.frame`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/data.frame.html) based on
  `object`, with an added column named as specified by argument
  `prev_date` of class [`Date`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Dates.html)
  containing the values of the previous test dates.

- `get_prev_date()`:

  A `vector` of class [`Date`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Dates.html),
  length [`nrow`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/nrow.html)`(object)`,
  containing the values of the previous test dates ordered in the exact
  sequence of the `subject` and `timepoint` in `object`.
